**Objective**

The primary objective is to analyze McDonald's menu comprehensively, addressing concerns about its potential impact on health. We'll evaluate calories, fat,proteins, sodium, and nutrients in popular items like burgers, fries, and salads to offer valuable health insights. By including a calorie calculator, we aim to empower users to make mindful choices and manage their intake better. Additionally, we'll explore McDonald's initiatives for healthier options, like canola-based oil and reduced trans fats, promoting a more balanced and health-conscious dining experience. Our objective is to encourage informed decisions and positive dietary habits among consumers.
